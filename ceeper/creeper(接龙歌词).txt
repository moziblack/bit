Creeper?
Creeper
Aw Man
Aw-a-a-a Man
Side side to side
So way back in the mine got are pickaxe swingin' from side to side
Heads up
You hear a sound turn around and look up
Total shock fills your body
Oh no it's you again I can never forget those eyes
Eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Cause baby tonight the creeper's
Tryin to steal all your stuff again
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin' to steal all your stuff again
Stuff again gain
Just when you think you're safe
Over here some hissing from right behind right right behind
That's a nice life you have
Shame it's got to end at this time time time
Time time time time
Blows up and then your health bar drops
Get inside don't be tardy
So now you're stuck in there
Halve a heart is left but don't die
Die die die die die                          
Aw Man!
